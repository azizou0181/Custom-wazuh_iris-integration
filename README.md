# Custom-wazuh_iris-integration
This repository contains a custom script designed for integrating Wazuh with IRIS. It leverages the Wazuh Indexer API to fetch alerts directly from the Wazuh Indexer, instead of the Wazuh Manager. This approach maximizes the use of normalized fields, ensuring more accurate, consistent, and efficient data processing throughout security logs.
